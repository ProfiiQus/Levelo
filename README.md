# Levelo

Levelo is a leveling plugin written for Spigot. For server owners, it's offering a lot of completely customizable features - from rewards to custom experience points per blocks, mobs or even items smelted. It's currently in development, however you can purchase an older version (that's somewhat working) [here](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/authors/191499/).

For information about the plugin, please refer to this repo's wiki pages.
